## About the Site

A personal website with a retro 90s computer terminal aesthetic, featuring sections for career, consulting, and artistic projects.

## Running Locally

Since this is a compiled React application, you can serve it using any static file server:

### Using Python:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### Using Node.js (http-server):
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
```

### Using PHP:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Note

This is the compiled/built version of the application. The original source code is not available as this was built using the Base44 platform. The JavaScript files are minified and not easily readable or editable.

If you need to modify this site, you would need to:
1. Access the original source code (if available from Base44)
2. Or rebuild the site from scratch using the design as reference
