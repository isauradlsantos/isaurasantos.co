    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 21 November 2025</p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Isaura Santos. This site is intentionally minimalist, but I still care about your privacy. This notice explains what personal data I collect, how I use it, and the rights you have under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

    <h2>Who is responsible?</h2>
    <p>Data controller: Isaura Santos<br>
    Email: <a href="mailto:isauraconsulting@gmail.com">isauraconsulting@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2>What data is collected?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact information</strong> – only if you email me or book a call. I receive the email address and any details you share voluntarily.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical data</strong> – your browser automatically shares standard information (IP address, device, timestamps) when you visit the site. I do not store this data personally, but my hosting providers (GitHub Pages) may log it for security and troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent cookie</strong> – a single cookie is stored when you accept the cookie notice, so it does not show up again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is the data used?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To respond to your enquiries or schedule a call (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).</li>
      <li>To keep the site secure and functional (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR legitimate interest).</li>
      <li>To record your consent choices (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How long is it kept?</h2>
    <p>Emails and booking details are kept for as long as we are in contact plus up to 12 months, unless legal obligations require otherwise. The consent cookie lasts one year.</p>

    <h2>Who receives the data?</h2>
    <p>I use a few external services to run this site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub Pages – website hosting</li>
      <li>TidyCal – call scheduling</li>
      <li>Email providers involved when you send a message</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These processors act on my instructions and provide their own security safeguards. I do not sell or share your data for advertising.</p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>Some services are located outside the EU/EEA. They rely on standard contractual clauses or other safeguards approved by the European Commission.</p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>You can request access, rectification, deletion, restriction, or portability of your data. You may also object to processing based on legitimate interest or withdraw consent at any time. Email <a href="mailto:isauraconsulting@gmail.com">isauraconsulting@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If you believe your data is handled unlawfully, you can lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>I may update this notice if the site changes. The latest version will always appear here.</p>
